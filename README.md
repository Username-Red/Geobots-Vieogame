# Overview

I have written a fairly simplisting and slightly janky point and click adventure game based around the Lego Fan Theme called Geobots.

My purpose in writing this software is to demonstrate what can be accomplished with a fairly limited understanding of JavaScript and a VERY tight deadline.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

VS Code and YouTube, with my good friend ChatGPT acting as a tutor at times.

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a foreign JS library called Howler.js to deal with the music.

# Future Work


- Item 1: The inventory. I did not have enough time to implement it properly.
- Item 2: Working with items. The plan was to be much more reliant on items than what ended up being possible, once again due to time constraints.
- Item 3: I'd like to add the actual ending I was planning, in which you go into the cave, pull out your light crystal, and then fight a bit bad guy. S
